Frozen and/or Restrained Atoms
ibelly

ntr
  Flag for restraining atoms in cartesian space. If ntr > 0, restrained atoms are specified by restraintmask
restraint_wt
  The weight used to restrain atoms (Units of kcal/mol-A^2)
restraintmask
  Only use if ntr = 1. Atoms that are restrained (See Amber Manual Section 19.1.1)
bellymask
  Specifies moving atoms when ibelly = 1. (Deprecated)

Energy Minimization
maxcyc
  Maximum number of minimization cycles (Default 1)
ncyc
  if ntmin = 1, after ncyc cycles, minimization method will be switched from steepest descent to conjugate gradient. (Default 10)
ntmin
  Declares minimization method
  0: Full conjugate gradient minimization (First 4 cycles are steepest descent)
  1: Runs steepest descent for ncyc cycles, then goes to conjugate gradient. (Default)
  2: Only uses steepest descent
  3: Uses the XMIN Method (Amber Manual Section 20.7.1)
  4: Uses the LMOD Method (Amber Manual Section 20.7.2)
dx0
  Initial step length. It's best to not mess with this (Default 0.01)

Molecular Dynamics
nstlim
  Number of MD-steps to be performed (Default 1)
nscm
  Flag to remove translational and rotational center-of-mass motions at regular intervals (Default is 1000). This is ignored for belly simulations
t
  Sets the time at the start of the simulation in picoseconds. Start time comes from the coordinate file if irest = 1, else Default = 0.0
dt
  Time step in picoseconds. If shake is on, max is 0.002. If shake is off, max is 0.001. Using HMR, you can use timesteps up to 0.004, but this is not recommended. (Default 0.001).
nrespa
  Allows the user to evaluate the slowly-varying terms of the force-field less frequently. This is not that useful.

Temperature Regulation

tautp
  Time constant in ps for heating if ntt = 1. (Default 1.0)  (USE THE DEFAULT)
gamma_ln
  Sets collision frequency when ntt = 3 (Default 0).
vrand
  If vrand > 0 and ntt = 2, velocities are randomized to temp0 every vrand steps. (Default 1000)
vlimit
  If any component of velocity is greater than abs(vlimit), it will be reduced to vlimit. This assumes that vlimit is not 0 (Default 20).
nkija
  Sets number of substeps of dt when integrating thermostat equations. Only use if ntt = 9 or ntt = 10. (Default 1)
idistr
  For ntt = 9, this sets the frequency at which the thermostat velocity distribution functions are accumulated
sinrtau
  For ntt = 10, this specifies the time scale for determining the masses associated with the velocity variables v1 and v2 (Default 1.0).
  
Pressure Regulation
ntp
  Toggles constant pressure. Set to 1 or 2 when using Constant Pressure and periodic boundries.
  0: No pressure scaling (Default)
  1: MD with Isotropic position scaling
  2: MD with anisotropic pressure scaling
  3: MD with semiisotropic pressure scaling -- Requires csurften > 0
barostat
  Controls which barostat is used
  1: Berendsen (Default)
  2: Monte Carlo
mcbarint
  Number of steps between volume change attempts (Part of Monte Carlo Barostat -- Default: 1000)
press0
  Sets reaction pressure in bar, used when ntp > 0. (Default 1.0)
comp
  Compressibility of the system, used when ntp > 0. (Default 44.6 -- units are E-06 bar ^ -1)
taup
  Pressure relaxation time in picoseconds, used when ntp > 0. Use values between 1.0 and 5.0 (Default 1.0). 
baroscalingdir
  0: Box scales randomly (x, y, z) each step (Default)

  2: Constant Surface tension in the xz plane
  3: Constant Surface tension in the xy plane
gamma_ten
  Surface tension value (Default 0.0 dyne/cm).
ninterface
  Number of interfaces in the periodic box -- There must be AT LEAST 2 interfaces (Default 2).

SHAKE
ntc
  Toggles Shake, which constrains bond lengths. The MD timestep is set by the fastest motions in the system (NOTES: ntf MUST EQUAL ntc!!! ALSO, DO NOT USE IN THE MINIMIZATION)
  1: SHAKE is not used.
  2: Only bonds involving hydrogen are constrained.
  3: All bonds are constrained (Can't use in parallel or with sander qmmm)
tol
