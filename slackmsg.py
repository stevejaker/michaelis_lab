| An Tutorial of slackmsg |
 -------------------------

Intro:
    slackmsg is a command line tool designed to make it easy to upload files to Slack
    directly from the command line. slackmsg is platform independent and has zero
    dependencies, allowing it to be used on any system at any time. This allows you
    to upload any sort of file (picture, text file, script, etc.) from both the your
    local machine or the server by typing only a few words. 
    
    While slackmsg provides you with the oportunity to alert a particular user of the 
    file you are sending, it is not configured to send messages to direct message 
    channels. This is advantageous because it forces files to be published in a public
    channel where all team members have the ability to access a particular file. Often,
    files need to be sent to different people at different times and this allows people
    to search for files already posted within slack in a manner that is much easier than
    searching through a shared folder on the supercomputer. This will also limit the 
    amount of memory taken up on shared supercomputer drives.
    
    By default, files are posted to #virtual_peptide and you will be prompted for which
    Slack user you want to alert of your message. It's important to note that you can tag
    any user in any channel, even if they are not in the channel. If a user is not in the 
    channel, they will not get the notification unless you invite them to that channel.
    Using the -ac/--at_channel flag will tag @channel rather than an individual user. This
    will send a notification to every member of the channel. Be aware of this when posting 
    files with these flags as it can quickly become annoying.
    
    The -t/--thread flags are also a particularly useful options as they add the message as
    a thread to a previous message. The timestamp must be in unix time (IE: 1580837811.0515).
    This timestamp must be exact, otherwise it is ignored. This feature is usually only
    used for repeat file postings. After a file is posted, the timestamp from that file
    is posted to the terminal output. Additionally, when posting multiple files, 
    subsequent files are posted in the thread of the first file.

Detailed Usage Information:
    slackmsg [options] <filename> 
    slackmsg [options] <filename1,filename2,etc.> 
    slackmsg [options] all
    
    The file name (including a list of files the 'all' keyword) is required for this script
    to function. The last command argument is assumed to be the filename. Failure to include
    command line args will cause the script to terminate with an error. If command line args
    are included, but the filename is not, the final argument will be assumed to be the file.
    An error will occur when uploading the file if the file cannot be found. In an attempt to
    prevent errors files not in the directory will be ignored in runtime.

Basic Usage Examples:
    slackmsg prod0.mdcrd      Uploads `prod0.mdcrd` to the default channel.
    slackmsg -c prod0.mdcrd   Prompts user for a channel, uploads `prod0.mdcrd` to that channel.
    slackmsg -ac prod0.mdcrd  Uploads `prod0.mdcrd` to the default channel, tagging all users.
    slackmsg -m prod0.mdcrd   Prompts user for a message, uploads `prod0.mdcrd` to default channel.
    slackmsg all              Prompts user for a channel, uploads all files in the working directory.

Advanced Usage Example:
    slackmsg -c -ac -m prod0.mdcrd,prod1.mdcrd,prod2.mdcrd

    This prompts the user for a message and a channel. All files are posted to the selected channel 
    with prod1.mdcrd and prod2.mdcrd being placed in the thread. The whole channel is notified of 
    the file being posted.
